# ListPad
The purpose of this application is to provide an interface for reminders/alarms for the user. 
The user can list multiple reminders and each one will be displayed in list form. 
Each reminder can attach an alarm to it. The user will receive a notification when the alarm rings. 
You can swipe reminders to remove them. The main page contains a menu button. 
The menu contains the ‘Settings’ and ‘About’ activities. 
The only setting we have is a night mode setting, which will change the colors into a darker color scheme.
